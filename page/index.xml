      <description>Hello. I&amp;rsquo;m Cheng. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing music in my spare time just for fun for more than 6 years.
Some of my works are posted here so you can have a look.
Most of the tracks are for game and they are in
EDM music (for high-tech themed games) Horror music (for some ghost-chasing games) Ambient music (for some sightseeing games, but mainly for the game credit scene) Chilli music (for some calm games) Hope you like my music (and me as well).</description>
